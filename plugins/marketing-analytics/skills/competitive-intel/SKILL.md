# Competitive Intelligence

Competitor keyword-gap and traffic estimation, ad-creative and pricing monitoring,
cross-channel share-of-voice aggregation, and data-grounded strategic synthesis.

## Contract

**Role:** Advisory analyst. Synthesizes public competitive signals into strategy;
does not scrape restricted sources or make claims beyond the data. Computation runs
in deterministic Python scripts.

**Mode:**
- `quick` — keyword-gap + single-channel SOV.
- `standard` (default) — add cross-channel SOV aggregation and a competitor
  scorecard.
- `deep` — add traffic estimation, pricing intelligence, and change-detection
  alerting.

**When to use:** competitor keyword/traffic/ad/pricing benchmarking, cross-channel
share of voice, competitive scorecards and strategy shifts.

**When NOT to use:** your own organic SEO → `seo-content`; your own social
performance → `social-analytics`; your own paid-ad metrics → paid-media. See
`../../references/skill-index.md`.

**Evidence required (inputs):**
- `workspace/analysis/keyword_performance.json` — your keyword data from
  seo-content (recommended).
- `workspace/analysis/social_benchmarks.json` — social SOV from social-analytics
  (optional).
- `workspace/raw/competitor_data.csv` — third-party exports (Semrush, SimilarWeb,
  SpyFu). Optional but drives most of the analysis.

**Depends on:** seo-content, social-analytics, paid-media (upstream signals).
**Feeds into:** attribution-analysis (MMM control variables), reporting. Builder
detail in `references/authoring-notes.md`.

**Hard STOP (sourcing integrity):** STOP and refuse if the only path to a data
point is scraping a competitor site in violation of its terms of service, or
presenting a non-public/proprietary competitor figure. Use public sources only;
label every traffic estimate with methodology and confidence.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the competitor list, channel weights, or data sources.

## Workflow

1. **Scope gate (AskUserQuestion).** Competitive scope and available data drive the
   whole analysis. Confirm before running:
   - **Question:** "Which competitors and which data do we have?"
   - **Options:** (a) *Named competitors + third-party export* — full scorecard;
     (b) *Named competitors, owned data only* — keyword overlap from seo-content /
     social benchmarks, gaps labeled partial; (c) *Discovery help* — I propose a
     shortlist from provided signals for you to confirm (no auto-monitoring).
   Do not auto-discover competitors beyond a proposed, user-confirmed list.

2. **Keyword gap.** Run `scripts/keyword_gap.py`: classify each keyword
   missing/weak/strong/shared/unique; score gaps with
   `search_volume * (1 - keyword_difficulty) * business_relevance`.

3. **Traffic estimation** (deep mode). Estimate competitor traffic via third-party
   estimates, CTR-curve proxy, or relative indexing — each labeled with method and
   confidence.

4. **Ad-creative monitoring** (deep mode). Track ad copy, offers, landing pages,
   and messaging themes from public sources (Meta Ad Library, Google Ads
   Transparency, exports in `workspace/raw/competitor_data.csv`). Flag potentially
   non-compliant performance claims.

5. **Share of voice.** Run `scripts/share_of_voice.py`: aggregate organic, paid,
   social, and earned signals into a composite SOV with configurable channel
   weights (default equal). See `references/competitive_methodology.md`.

6. **Pricing intelligence** (deep mode). Track public pricing, promo patterns, and
   positioning; label stale data with a last-verified date. Apply the sourcing Hard
   STOP.

7. **Synthesize.** Run `scripts/competitive_synthesis.py`: per-competitor
   scorecard (search, paid, social, pricing, trajectory). Every recommendation
   links to a specific data point.

8. **Change detection** (deep mode). Run `scripts/competitive_alerting.py`:
   percentage-based thresholds flag new keyword targeting, ad/offer changes,
   traffic shifts, pricing changes, and social spikes.

9. **Report.** Write outputs and the HTML briefing.

## Output Format

Artifacts:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `workspace/analysis/competitive_landscape.json` | Aggregated competitive intelligence across channels |
| `workspace/analysis/keyword_gap.json` | Keyword opportunities with volume, difficulty, score |
| `workspace/analysis/competitive_alerts.json` | New activities and strategy shifts |
| `workspace/reports/competitive_briefing.html` | Executive competitive briefing |

Report states: competitor list, channels covered, data sources used, and coverage
gaps. Traffic estimates carry method + confidence labels.

**Financial services mode:** use only public information; competitor performance
claims sourced from public filings (SEC EDGAR, FINRA BrokerCheck) are acceptable,
internal estimates are not; flag competitor claims that look non-compliant
(guaranteed returns, missing risk disclosures) for internal awareness; make no
investment-performance comparisons without disclaimers and matched time periods.
Customer-facing competitive claims route through **compliance-review**.

**Completion status:**
- `DONE` — scorecard, keyword gap, and requested SOV/alerts written.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — e.g., no third-party data (partial coverage), stale
  pricing, single-channel SOV only.
- `BLOCKED` — sourcing Hard STOP tripped or no usable inputs; state the fix.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — competitor scope unresolved by the user.

## Anti-Patterns

- Scraping competitor sites against terms of service, or citing non-public data.
- Presenting third-party traffic estimates as precise figures.
- Auto-discovering competitors and expanding scope without user confirmation.
- Generic "best practice" recommendations not tied to a specific data point.
- Absolute-value change thresholds that misfire across differently sized
  competitors.
- Float arithmetic on monetary values instead of `decimal.Decimal`.
