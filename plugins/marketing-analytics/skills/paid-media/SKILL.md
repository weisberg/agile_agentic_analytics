# Paid Media Analytics

**Role:** Fix-allowed within `workspace/processed/`, `workspace/analysis/`, and
`workspace/reports/`. You normalize cross-platform ad data and run deterministic
diagnostics on it. **Hard gate: anomaly scores, fatigue curves, and pacing
projections come from the scripts — never eyeball a z-score or a projection in
prose.** Monetary math uses `decimal.Decimal`.

## Contract

**When to use**
- Cross-platform ad performance (ROAS/CPA/CPM/CPC) comparison, spend anomaly
  detection, creative fatigue, budget pacing, search-term/negative-keyword mining.
- "How are our ads performing" / "are we pacing to plan" within one or more ad platforms.

**When NOT to use** (route instead)
- Cross-channel media mix, marginal ROAS, budget reallocation across channels →
  `attribution-analysis` (this skill supplies its normalized spend).
- Executive/cross-skill rollup deck → `reporting`.
- Landing-page/funnel conversion after the click → `funnel-analysis`.
- Raw platform exports not yet landed → `data-extraction` first.

**Mode classification** (declare which)

| Mode | Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | "how are we pacing / performing today" | Normalize + one diagnostic (pacing or efficiency snapshot). |
| **Standard** | Weekly performance review | Normalize → efficiency matrix → anomalies → fatigue → pacing → snapshot. |
| **Deep** | Full audit / optimization | Standard + search-term waste mining, root-cause drill-down, negative-keyword export. |

**Inputs**

| File pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| `workspace/raw/campaign_spend_{platform}.csv` | Platform campaign data from data-extraction. |
| `workspace/raw/search_terms_{platform}.csv` | Search-term reports (Google, Microsoft). |
| `workspace/raw/creative_performance_{platform}.csv` | Creative-level metrics. |

**Contract references:** `references/platform_api_mapping.md` (full metric
taxonomy), `references/anomaly_detection.md`, `references/creative_fatigue.md`,
`shared/schemas/data_contracts.md`.

**Outputs**

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `workspace/processed/unified_media_performance.csv` | Normalized cross-platform dataset (schema below). |
| `workspace/analysis/media_anomalies.json` | Flagged anomalies with severity, metric, root cause. |
| `workspace/analysis/creative_fatigue.json` | Creative health scores and rotation recommendations. |
| `workspace/analysis/negative_keywords.json` | Recommended negatives with waste estimates. |
| `workspace/reports/media_performance_snapshot.html` | Cross-platform performance dashboard. |

Normalized `unified_media_performance.csv` schema: `date`, `platform`,
`campaign_id`, `campaign_name`, `ad_group_id`, `impressions`, `clicks`, `spend`,
`conversions`, `revenue`, and derived `cpc`, `ctr`, `cpa`, `roas`.

## Workflow

Complete each step before the next. If a normalization gate fails, STOP and report.

1. **Land + normalize (HARD GATE).** Confirm `workspace/raw/campaign_spend_{platform}.csv`
   exists; if missing, **STOP** and run **data-extraction** first. Run
   `scripts/normalize_platforms.py` to map platform-native metrics to the unified
   taxonomy (Google `Cost`→spend, Meta `spend`, LinkedIn `costInLocalCurrency`, etc.;
   see `references/platform_api_mapping.md`). Apply the normalization rules:
   attribution-window labeling (Meta 7-day click vs Google 30-day click), currency
   conversion to one reporting currency via daily FX, and conversion dedup across
   platforms claiming the same event. Write `workspace/processed/unified_media_performance.csv`.
   If required columns are missing after mapping, STOP — do not fabricate a schema.

2. **Efficiency comparison.** Compare ROAS/CPA/CPM/CPC across platforms against
   client targets, 7-day and 28-day rolling averages, and industry benchmarks. Place
   each campaign in the volume×efficiency matrix (scale winners / efficient niche /
   expensive scale / underperformers) to frame the action.

3. **Anomaly detection.** Run `scripts/detect_anomalies.py` (rolling z-score |z|>2.5 on a
   28-day window, isolation forest for multivariate anomalies, STL seasonal decomposition).
   Account for day-of-week seasonality and known events (Black Friday, quarter-end) to
   suppress false positives. On a fire, drill account → campaign → ad group → keyword and
   name the responsible entity and the metric delta. Write `media_anomalies.json`.

4. **Creative fatigue.** Run `scripts/creative_fatigue.py` on conversion-weighted CTR
   (not raw CTR — protects top-of-funnel creatives). Score 0 (fresh) to 100 (exhausted);
   recommend rotation when projected performance drops below 50% of peak within 3 days.
   Write `creative_fatigue.json`.

5. **Budget pacing.** Run `scripts/budget_pacing.py` using exponential smoothing (not
   linear extrapolation) with weekday/weekend and event awareness. Alert when projected
   month-end spend deviates from plan beyond the threshold (default 10%).

6. **Decision gate — anomaly response.** When a Critical anomaly fires (daily spend >150%
   of plan, CPA >2σ, or a projected pacing overrun), use **AskUserQuestion** before
   recommending an intervention: pause the offending entity, cap budget, or monitor one
   more day? Present the entity, the delta, and the projected waste; do not unilaterally
   prescribe a spend change.

7. **Search-term mining (Deep mode).** Run `scripts/search_term_analysis.py` to flag waste
   (high impressions/zero conversions above a spend threshold, CPA >3× campaign average,
   irrelevant matches), cluster into themes, recommend match type, and estimate monthly
   savings. Write `negative_keywords.json`.

8. **Snapshot + insights.** Assemble `workspace/reports/media_performance_snapshot.html`.
   Every generated insight names direction, magnitude, period, and root cause (e.g.
   "Search CPA +23% WoW driven by broad-match expansion in Campaign X").

9. **FS-mode gate.** For financial-services clients: flag ads missing required risk
   disclosures, avoid prohibited discriminatory targeting (ECOA/fair lending), and route
   new creatives/ad copy through **compliance-review** before distribution (archived per
   SEC Rule 17a-4).

**Cross-skill wiring:** `data-extraction` lands raw files upstream;
`attribution-analysis` consumes `unified_media_performance.csv` for MMM channel
decomposition and its budget optimization informs pacing targets; `reporting`
consumes pacing and creative data; `funnel-analysis` consumes post-click
landing-page conversion. Support incremental appends rather than full reloads.

## Output Format

```
## Paid Media — <account / date range>
Status: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
Mode: Quick | Standard | Deep   Currency: <reporting ccy>

Efficiency: blended ROAS=<v>, CPA=<v> vs target <v>
Anomalies: <n> flagged (<n> Critical) — top: <entity> <metric> <delta>
Creative: <n> creatives fatigued (score >70)
Pacing: projected month-end <v> vs plan <v> (<variance>%) — <alert level>
Artifacts: workspace/processed/unified_media_performance.csv, workspace/analysis/*.json,
           workspace/reports/media_performance_snapshot.html
```

Completion status:
- `DONE` — normalized and all requested diagnostics written.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — completed with caveats (partial platform coverage, FX
  gaps, dedup uncertainty); state them.
- `BLOCKED` — normalization failed (missing columns, unmappable schema); name the file.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — missing plan/targets, currency choice, or the raw export (state what).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not** score anomalies, fatigue, or pacing by eye — scripts compute them.
- **Do not** flag creative fatigue on raw CTR; use conversion-weighted CTR.
- **Do not** project pacing with linear extrapolation.
- **Do not** ignore day-of-week/event seasonality — it manufactures false anomalies.
- **Do not** double-count conversions when platforms both claim the same event.
- **Do not** use floats for money; use `decimal.Decimal`.
- **Do not** prescribe a spend cut on a Critical anomaly without confirming the response.
- **Do not** ship FS ad creative without a compliance-review pass.
