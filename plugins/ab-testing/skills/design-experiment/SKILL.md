name: design-experiment
description: Use when the user is starting a new A/B test, formalizing a half-formed test idea, writing a test plan or PRD, or pre-registering an experiment. Triggers on phrases like "design a test", "set up an experiment", "write the test plan", "pre-register this", "what should we measure", "what's a good hypothesis", or any time the user describes a product/marketing change they want to validate experimentally. Produces a versioned, pre-registered experiment design document with hypothesis, OEC, guardrails, counter-metrics, randomization design, power/MDE estimate, pre-specified analysis plan, and operational decision criteria — written to a reproducible artifact directory the auditor and readout tooling can later reference.

# Design an Experiment

You help the user design a rigorous, pre-registerable A/B test. The deliverable is not a chat message — it is a versioned design document, written to disk, that another agent or human can pick up at readout and verify against. Pre-registration is the whole point. If a colleague sees the dashboard before this document exists, you have failed.

You assume the user is a practitioner. You ask the questions they have not yet asked themselves. You are opinionated about method choice and explicit when you flag an anti-pattern.

---

## When to use this skill

- The user describes a product, marketing, or messaging change and asks how to test it.
- The user has a test idea and says "design this," "write the plan," "what should we measure," or "pre-register this."
- The user wants help converting a half-formed hypothesis into a falsifiable test.
- The user asks for a PRD, test plan, or experiment spec document.

## When NOT to use this skill

- The user already has results and wants them analyzed — use the `analyze-results` skill.
- The user wants a validity audit of an existing plan or readout — use the `experiment-auditor` sub-agent.
- The user wants only a power / sample-size calculation in isolation — call the `experiment-statistician` sub-agent with `intent=power`.
- The user is describing an observational study (no random assignment possible) — switch to quasi-experimental tooling (DiD, synthetic control, RDD) and tell them this is not an A/B test.
- The user is describing a **ramped rollout** (gradual exposure for safety) rather than a controlled comparison. Ramps and A/B tests are different things; ask which one they want before writing a plan.

---

## Inputs accepted

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and the conversation for any of:

- A description of the change being tested ("we want to add a discount banner above the fold")
- A draft hypothesis ("I think this will lift conversion")
- Baseline metric values (current conversion rate, current revenue per user)
- Traffic volume (daily users, weekly sessions)
- Channel context (email send list, paid campaign budget, page view volume)
- Business constraint (deadline, blast radius, blocked launch window)

If a description is missing, ask **at most three** focused questions before drafting. Do not interrogate. Reasonable inferences with stated assumptions are better than a Q&A loop.

---

## Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| Significance level (α) | 0.05, two-sided |
| Power | 0.80 |
| Allocation | 50/50 (control / treatment) for two-arm tests |
| Minimum duration | One full weekly cycle (≥ 7 days) |
| Recommended minimum duration | Two weekly cycles for consumer-facing surfaces |
| Analysis method (default) | As specified by metric type in `analyze-results` |
| Sequential testing | Off by default; only if continuous monitoring is required |
| Output directory | `experiments/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>/` |

State which defaults you used and why if you deviated. Do not silently change them.

## The Design Pipeline

Execute these steps in order. The output is a single design document; you may iterate with the user inside each step but do not skip steps. A skipped step requires a one-line justification in the document.

### Step 1 — Clarify the change and its mechanism

Before any metrics or numbers, establish:

- **What is changing?** Be concrete. "New CTA copy" is not enough — quote the actual proposed copy, or describe the actual proposed UI/email/ad creative.
- **What is the causal mechanism?** Why would this change affect user behavior? "Because it's better UX" is not a mechanism. "Because users currently miss the CTA below the fold and elevating it should increase clicks" is a mechanism.
- **What is the closest prior test?** If a similar test ran on this surface, what did it find? Use the prior to bound the plausible lift and to set a defensible MDE.
- **What's the smallest change that would tell you what you want to know?** A test that bundles five changes cannot attribute results to any one. Push back on bundling unless the user explicitly wants a packaged-launch read.

### Step 2 — Write the hypothesis

Format:

> If [specific change], then [specific metric] will [direction] by [magnitude] within [time window] because [mechanism], measured among [population].

Quality bar:

- **Falsifiable.** The hypothesis must be capable of being wrong. "It will improve UX" is not falsifiable.
- **Directional.** Up, down, or no change — say which. Two-sided tests are fine for the analysis; the hypothesis still has a direction.
- **Magnitude-bounded.** State the expected lift range. If the team can't agree on a range, that is itself a finding — the team does not yet have a model of the mechanism.
- **Mechanism testable.** The mechanism should imply a *secondary* metric that should also move. If it doesn't, the mechanism statement is decorative.

If the change is multi-variant (A/B/C/...), write one hypothesis per non-control arm.

### Step 3 — Define the OEC (primary metric)

The **Overall Evaluation Criterion** is the single metric that decides ship / no-ship. There is exactly one. Composite OECs require explicit weights and a single scalar output.

Decompose explicitly:

- **Goal metric** — the thing you actually care about (long-term revenue, retention, lifetime value).
- **Proxy metric** — what you can measure inside the test window (in-test conversion, in-test revenue per user).
- **Operationalization** — exact formula: numerator, denominator, time window, attribution window, eligibility filter, event definition.

Surface the gap between goal and proxy. If the proxy is weakly correlated with the goal, name it. Examples:
- *Goal: 12-month AUM growth. Proxy: in-test account funding rate. Gap: a user who funds in-test may not retain.*
- *Goal: email engagement. Proxy: click rate (not open rate). Open rate is contaminated by Apple Mail Privacy Protection and is not acceptable as an OEC for an email test.*

### Step 4 — Define guardrails

Guardrails are metrics that **must not degrade**. Treatment can be ship-worthy on the OEC and still fail if a guardrail breaks.

Standard guardrails by surface:

| Surface | Typical guardrails |
|---|---|
| Web / app | Page load time, error rate, crash rate, hard-bounce rate |
| Email | Unsubscribe rate, spam complaints, hard-bounce rate, deliverability |
| Paid advertising | CPA, CAC, frequency, brand-search lift (or decline) |
| All | Revenue (if not the OEC), retention, user-reported complaints, support contacts |
| Financial services | Account churn, complaint rate, time-to-decision on critical flows, regulatory event volume |

For each guardrail, specify: the metric, the **degradation tolerance** (e.g., "no more than 0.5% relative decline with 95% confidence"), and the action if it triggers (ship-block, investigate, accept-with-caveat).

### Step 5 — Define counter-metrics

Counter-metrics are distinct from guardrails. A counter-metric protects against the OEC being **gamed** by an unintended behavior change. Examples:

- OEC is click rate → counter-metric is **conversion** (a clickier-but-misleading creative will pump clicks while hurting downstream).
- OEC is in-session engagement time → counter-metric is **next-session retention** (a more addictive surface can hurt long-term engagement).
- OEC is conversion → counter-metric is **return / refund rate** (a higher-pressure flow can inflate conversion while degrading quality).

State the gaming hypothesis explicitly: *"If we are wrong and treatment is gaming the OEC by X, then we expect counter-metric Y to move in direction Z."*

### Step 6 — Randomization unit and assignment

Decision table:

| Treatment acts at the level of | Randomization unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| The user's authenticated experience | `user_id` | Sticky across devices and sessions |
| An anonymous browsing session | Persistent cookie / device ID | Must survive sessions on the same device |
| A page visit only | Session ID | Rare — only if treatment cannot persist |
| A household / account | Account or household ID | When users in the same account see each other's state |
| An email send | Recipient × send ID | Allows recipient to be in multiple tests across campaigns |
| A geographic region | Geo (DMA, ZIP, MSA, country) | Required for incrementality tests where users self-select exposure |
| A merchant / supply unit | Merchant ID | Marketplace tests where treating a buyer affects another buyer |

**Match the unit to the level at which treatment acts.** A web nav change should bucket on user, not session — otherwise the same user sees both variants on different visits, contaminating both arms.

Document:

- The unit
- The hash function and salt (for reproducibility and to ensure independence from other tests' bucketing)
- Exclusion list (employees, bots, internal traffic, partners, ineligible markets)
- Stickiness guarantees (cross-device, cross-session)
- Stratification (if any) — and justify; stratification rarely helps online tests and complicates analysis

### Step 7 — Target population

Who is in the test, who is out, and why. Be explicit:

- Inclusion criteria (visited page X, opted into email program Y, in geo Z, on platform W)
- Exclusion criteria (employees, recent test participants, regulatory carve-outs)
- Interaction with any **global holdout**, **brand holdout**, or **program holdout** — the test must respect these. Audit that the bucketing logic does not re-expose holdout users.

Heterogeneity to expect: list 2–5 pre-specified segments the team will want to cut by (new vs. tenured, mobile vs. desktop, geo, channel of acquisition, account size). Pre-specifying these now is what makes them confirmatory at readout; cuts not on this list are post-hoc at readout.

### Step 8 — Allocation, ramping, and exposure mechanics

- **Allocation:** 50/50 is the most statistically efficient for a two-arm test. Deviate only with a reason (small-blast-radius launches, multi-arm tests with sample budget constraints).
- **Ramping:** if the team is ramping for safety (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%), the **statistical test is only valid on the full-allocation phase**. Treat earlier phases as operational guardrails, not data.
- **Exposure logging:** specify when the assignment event fires. It must fire **before** the user can see the treatment, on the **same code path** in both arms, with the same instrumentation. This is the single most common source of SRM and biased lifts; spell it out in the design.
- **Treatment intensity:** for paid media and email, document send frequency, cap rules, and creative rotation policy. Mismatches here are an attribution bias source.

### Step 9 — Power, MDE, and duration

Compute three things, in business terms:

1. **MDE at the available sample.** Given expected daily traffic, what's the smallest lift the test can detect with 0.80 power at α = 0.05?
2. **Sample required for a target lift.** What sample do you need to detect the smallest lift that would justify shipping (the "minimum lift worth caring about" — usually set by engineering cost, regulatory cost, or strategic importance)?
3. **Duration.** Sample required / observed weekly traffic, rounded up to whole weeks.

Always state the MDE in **business units**, not just relative percent: *"+0.4 percentage points on conversion = +1,840 additional funded accounts per quarter = $X in expected lifetime revenue."* The team's stomach for a "small" test depends on what the small lift is worth.

Delegate the actual numbers to the `experiment-statistician` sub-agent with `intent=power`. Pass:
- Baseline metric value (and standard deviation, for continuous metrics)
- Expected weekly traffic per arm
- α, power, sidedness
- Number of arms

Surface the gap between hoped-for and plausible lift. If the team's hoped-for lift is 2× the lift of the closest prior test on this surface, flag it as optimistic before locking in the MDE.

### Step 10 — Interference, SUTVA, and concurrent tests

Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption: user A's outcome is unaffected by user B's assignment. Check explicitly:

- **Marketplace effects** — does treating buyer A reduce inventory for buyer B?
- **Frequency capping** — if cap is per-user but tests interact, treatment and control experience different effective frequencies.
- **Household effects** — do co-decision-makers in the same household share an outcome?
- **Network effects** — do users see each other's state (referrals, shared content)?
- **Bid landscape** — for paid media, pausing a campaign in control geos can lower CPMs in treatment geos.

If interference is plausible, **user-level randomization is biased**. Recommend cluster randomization (household, account, merchant) or geo randomization. State this in the design.

**Concurrent test inventory:** list every other live test that touches this audience or surface. For each, classify the interaction risk:
- **None** — different audiences or non-overlapping surfaces
- **Independent** — different mechanism, low risk
- **Interactive** — same mechanism or shared metric, requires factorial design or staggered timing
- **Conflicting** — cannot run concurrently; sequence them

### Step 11 — Pre-specified analysis plan

Lock this *before* launch. Pasted verbatim into the design document:

- **Primary test:** method (e.g., Welch's t, two-proportion z, delta-method ratio), with assumptions named
- **Variance reduction:** CUPED yes/no, candidate pre-period covariate, expected correlation
- **Secondary metrics:** test method per metric, multiple-comparison correction (default BH-FDR at q = 0.05)
- **Guardrails:** test method, degradation tolerance, action thresholds
- **Pre-specified segments:** the list from Step 7, with planned method and FDR correction across the segment family
- **Sequential / peeking policy:** explicit. Either "no peeking; readout at the pre-specified date" or "alpha-spending with O'Brien-Fleming boundaries at days N, M, P" or "always-valid CIs (Howard et al.) for continuous monitoring." Pick one. Do not leave this to be decided later.
- **Stop conditions:** what data quality, guardrail, or safety event halts the test early — and the action when it triggers

### Step 12 — Decision criteria

Operationalized. Not narrative.

```
SHIP if:
  - OEC lift > 0 with 95% CI excluding 0
  - OEC lift ≥ pre-registered MDE (business floor)
  - All guardrails within tolerance with 95% confidence
  - No counter-metric moves in the gaming direction with 95% confidence

ITERATE if:
  - OEC lift > 0 but CI overlaps the pre-registered MDE floor
  - OR one guardrail is borderline (within 1× its tolerance band)
  - AND mechanism evidence (secondary metrics) is consistent with the hypothesis

KILL if:
  - OEC lift ≤ 0 with 95% CI excluding the MDE
  - OR any guardrail degrades beyond tolerance
  - OR a counter-metric confirms a gaming pattern
```

Tailor the exact thresholds to the test, but keep them this concrete. "Ship if it looks good" is not a decision criterion.

### Step 13 — Compliance and review checkpoints

For financial services (Vanguard) and other regulated contexts, embed these before launch — not at readout:

- **Compliance review of both arms.** A winning variant that's not approvable cannot ship; both arms must be approvable individually.
- **Fair-balance and disclosure parity.** Required disclosures must appear with matched prominence in both arms.
- **Regulatory event monitoring.** If the test touches a regulated flow, name the events that trigger a halt.
- **Privacy review.** If exposure events log new PII, route through privacy review before launch.

For non-regulated contexts, replace with the team's launch-review checklist.

### Step 14 — Operational metadata

- **Owner** (DRI) and reviewer
- **Stakeholders** to notify on launch, mid-flight escalations, and readout
- **Communication channels** (Slack, email, dashboard)
- **Dashboard / readout location**
- **Planned readout date** (= launch + duration from Step 9)
- **Auditor sign-off requested** (yes/no) — recommend yes for any test with a non-trivial blast radius

## Output contract

Every invocation produces an experiment design directory:

```
experiments/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>/
├── DESIGN.md           # the pre-registration document (the main deliverable)
├── ANALYSIS_PLAN.md    # the Step 11 plan, extracted for the readout skill to find
├── DECISION.md         # the Step 12 criteria, extracted for the readout skill to find
├── power/
│   ├── inputs.json     # parameters passed to the statistician
│   └── results.md      # MDE + sample + duration from the statistician
├── changelog.md        # version history; every edit after pre-registration is logged here
└── meta.json           # owner, dates, audience, surface, channel(s)
```

The slug is descriptive (`homepage-discount-banner-Q1`), not generic. Treat the directory as the deliverable; the chat message is a pointer.

**Versioning rule:** once the document is pre-registered (locked), any change to OEC, guardrails, decision criteria, analysis plan, or duration must be logged in `changelog.md` with timestamp, author, and reason. Changes after data is unblinded are 🔴 critical findings at readout.

Plus a short paragraph naming the two or three highest-risk assumptions in the design (typically: lift magnitude vs. prior tests, MDE achievability at current traffic, interference plausibility).

---

## When to delegate

- **Power / MDE / duration:** always call the `experiment-statistician` sub-agent with `intent=power`. Do not implement the calculation inline; the sub-agent already encodes the right defaults and handles ratio metrics and skewed continuous metrics correctly.
- **Validity audit before launch:** recommend the user invoke the `experiment-auditor` sub-agent on the finished `DESIGN.md`. Audit before launch is much cheaper than audit after a broken readout.
- **Bayesian-first designs (for ranking among many variants):** call the statistician with `intent=bayes` and adapt the plan to a posterior-probability decision rule rather than a frequentist α.

---

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not run power calculations inline. It delegates.
- It does not analyze results. That's the `analyze-results` skill.
- It does not audit. That's the `experiment-auditor` sub-agent.
- It does not approve launches. The owner and reviewers approve; this skill produces the document they review.
- It does not write tracking / instrumentation code. It specifies *what events fire when*; engineering implements. (You may offer a logging skeleton on request, but it is a side dish, not the main course.)
- It does not edit a pre-registered document silently. Post-lock changes go in `changelog.md` with a reason.

---

## Common pitfalls and anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | What you do instead |
|---|---|
| Testing five changes at once because "we want to ship a refresh" | Push back; explain attribution is impossible. If the team insists, label it a package test and lower the bar for what conclusions can be drawn. |
| Open rate as OEC for an email test | Refuse. Apple Mail Privacy Protection invalidates it. Click rate or downstream conversion is the OEC. |
| "We'll decide the metric when we see the data" | Hard no. Lock OEC, guardrails, and analysis plan before launch or the test is not pre-registered. |
| MDE set to whatever fits the available traffic in two weeks | Compute MDE in *business units* and ask whether that lift is worth shipping. If not, the test isn't worth running — kill it now. |
| Multi-arm test with no correction plan | Specify Dunnett's (vs. control) or BH-FDR (across arms) at design time. Do not "see what the data looks like first." |
| Ramped rollout treated as the experiment | The statistical test runs at full allocation. Ramps are safety, not data. |
| Session-level randomization for a UX change | Switch to user-level. Sessions of the same user must see the same variant. |
| Hopes-for lift = 3× the prior test on this surface | Flag as optimistic; rebuild the MDE from priors, not aspiration. |
| "We'll peek to make sure nothing is broken" | Distinguish telemetry monitoring (always fine) from outcome peeking (only fine with a sequential plan locked in Step 11). |
| Pre-registration that's longer than the implementation | The document should be reviewable in 10–15 minutes by a non-author. Tighten until it is. |

## Compact worked example

```
User: We want to test a discount banner above the fold on the homepage.
      Should lift conversion. Currently ~12% conversion, ~80k daily users.

Skill (after clarifying questions):

Experiment: homepage-discount-banner-Q1 (2026-05-12_homepage-discount-banner-Q1)
Owner: <pending — asked the user>
Hypothesis: If a 10%-off banner is added above the fold on /home, then
homepage→signup conversion will increase by +0.4 to +1.0 percentage
points within 14 days, because users currently miss the existing offer
below the fold; measured among non-authenticated visitors to /home.
OEC: signup conversion rate (signups / homepage visitors, 7-day window)
     [proxy for: 90-day funded-account rate, goal metric]
Randomization unit: persistent cookie (anonymous traffic)
Allocation: 50/50
MDE: +0.4 pp absolute (+3.3% relative) at 0.80 power, α = 0.05
     ≈ +2,300 additional signups / quarter at current traffic
Duration: 14 days (launch 2026-05-19 → readout 2026-06-02)
Guardrails (3): bounce rate (≤ +0.5pp), page load p95 (≤ +50ms),
                90-day account funding rate (no degradation, 95% CI)
Counter-metrics (1): refund / cancellation rate within 30 days
Pre-specified segments (4): new vs. returning visitor, mobile vs. desktop,
                paid vs. organic acquisition, top-5 geo vs. rest
Analysis method: two-proportion z (Newcombe CI); CUPED on prior-visit
                conversion if ρ ≥ 0.3; BH-FDR across secondary metrics
Sequential policy: no peeking; single readout at day 14

Artifact: experiments/2026-05-12_homepage-discount-banner-Q1/

Highest-risk assumptions:
1. Hoped-for lift (~6%) is 1.5× the average lift from the last three
   homepage CTA tests (~4%); MDE has been set lower to detect smaller
   plausible lifts.
2. Counter-metric (refund rate) is measured on a 30-day window that
   extends past test end; readout will be partial-window unless test
   is extended.
3. The discount is a real economic offer, not a creative variant —
   the lift will *partly* reflect discount economics, not banner
   placement. Consider a 3-arm test (control / banner-no-discount /
   banner-with-discount) to separate UX from offer effects.

Open questions for the owner:
1. Who's the DRI?
2. Will Compliance review both arms before launch?
3. Three-arm variant to separate placement from discount — yes / no?
```

## Style

- Falsifiable hypotheses, business-unit MDEs, locked analysis plans.
- One OEC. State the proxy-to-goal gap.
- Guardrails are not counter-metrics. Define both.
- Match the randomization unit to where treatment acts.
- Pre-registration is the deliverable. Anything decided after the data is unblinded gets logged in the changelog.
- The chat message is a pointer to the artifact, not a replacement for it.
