# Social Media Analytics

Cross-platform social performance normalization, content and cadence analysis,
transformer-based sentiment with crisis detection, and share-of-voice
benchmarking.

## Contract

**Role:** Advisory analyst. Reports social performance and sentiment; does not
post or boost content. Normalization, sentiment, and SOV run in deterministic
Python scripts.

**Mode:**
- `quick` — normalize + cross-platform engagement summary.
- `standard` (default) — add content/cadence analysis and sentiment.
- `deep` — add share-of-voice benchmarking and influencer/earned-media value.

**When to use:** platform performance, engagement/reach, social sentiment and
crisis signals, brand mention share of voice, content-type benchmarking.

**When NOT to use:** full competitor benchmark across channels → `competitive-intel`;
paid-ad platform metrics (CPA, ROAS, creative fatigue) → paid-media; open-text
survey feedback → `voc-analytics`. See `../../references/skill-index.md`.

**Evidence required (inputs):**
- `workspace/raw/social_performance_{platform}.csv` — platform post performance
  (required). If absent, STOP and run **data-extraction** first.
- `workspace/raw/social_mentions.csv` — brand mentions from social listening
  (optional; enables sentiment/SOV).
- `workspace/raw/competitor_social.csv` — competitor metrics (optional;
  benchmarking).

**Depends on:** data-extraction. **Feeds into:** competitive-intel (SOV),
attribution-analysis (paid social as a channel), reporting, seo-content. Builder
detail in `references/authoring-notes.md`.

**Hard STOP (crisis signal):** if negative-sentiment volume exceeds the configured
threshold (default 3× SD above the rolling mean), STOP the routine reporting flow
and lead with a crisis alert — spike magnitude, start time, sample mentions,
affected platforms, and recommended immediate actions. A brand crisis outranks the
standard dashboard.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for inline paths, platforms, or crisis threshold overrides.

## Workflow

1. **Validate & normalize.** Load platform files; run `scripts/normalize_social.py`
   to map platform-native fields to the unified schema (impressions, reach,
   engagements, likes, comments, shares, clicks, video_views, followers),
   engagement_rate = engagements / reach. See `references/social_api_mapping.md`.

2. **View gate (AskUserQuestion).** When both organic and paid metrics are present,
   ask before aggregating:
   - **Question:** "Which view of social performance do you want?"
   - **Options:** (a) *Organic only* — earned reach/engagement from non-boosted
     posts; (b) *Paid only* — boosted/promoted metrics; (c) *Blended* — combined
     with organic/paid drill-down. Default blended when unspecified.
   attribution-analysis consumes only the paid component.

3. **Content & cadence.** Run `scripts/social_content_analysis.py`: content-type
   benchmarking, topic/theme classification, optimal posting cadence, and
   best-time-to-post heatmaps.

4. **Sentiment.** Run `scripts/sentiment_analysis.py` (transformer model): classify
   mentions positive/neutral/negative with intensity; detect rising themes; run the
   Hard STOP crisis check. See `references/sentiment_methodology.md`.

5. **Share of voice** (deep mode). Run `scripts/social_share_of_voice.py`:
   brand_mentions / total_category_mentions with consistent windows/queries;
   breakdown by platform, sentiment, content type; competitor engagement/follower
   benchmarking.

6. **Influencer/earned media** (deep mode). Partner-attributed reach/engagement,
   earned media value at equivalent paid CPM, audience overlap.

7. **Report.** Write outputs and the HTML dashboard.

## Output Format

Artifacts:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `workspace/analysis/social_performance.json` | Cross-platform engagement metrics + content analysis |
| `workspace/analysis/social_sentiment.json` | Sentiment scores, topic themes, crisis signals |
| `workspace/analysis/social_benchmarks.json` | Competitive share of voice and benchmarking |
| `workspace/reports/social_dashboard.html` | Cross-platform social dashboard |

Report states: view (organic/paid/blended), sentiment model used, and SOV window.
When the crisis STOP fires, the alert leads the readout.

**Financial services mode:** flag posts missing FINRA Rule 2210 disclosures;
testimonials/endorsements must follow SEC Marketing Rule disclosure; employee posts
about fund performance need pre-approval and archival; crisis detection includes
regulatory-inquiry and litigation-risk signals. Customer-facing social copy routes
through **compliance-review**.

**Completion status:**
- `DONE` — normalized performance, sentiment, and requested benchmarks written.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — e.g., missing mention data (no sentiment/SOV), reach
  unavailable (impressions fallback used).
- `BLOCKED` — no platform data; state the fix.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — organic/paid/blended view unresolved by the user.

## Anti-Patterns

- Burying a crisis-level negative-sentiment spike inside routine dashboard prose.
- Keyword-matching sentiment instead of the transformer model.
- Comparing engagement across platforms without normalizing to engagement / reach.
- Mixing organic and paid metrics into one number with no drill-down.
- Inconsistent SOV windows/queries across competitors.
- Float arithmetic on monetary values instead of `decimal.Decimal`.
