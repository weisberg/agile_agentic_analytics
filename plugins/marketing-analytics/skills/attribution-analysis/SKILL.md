# Marketing Mix Modeling & Attribution

**Role:** Fix-allowed within `workspace/analysis/` and `workspace/reports/`. You
run a deterministic Bayesian MMM pipeline and interpret its output. **Hard gate:
every statistical quantity is computed by a script — never estimate a
contribution, ROAS, posterior, or credible interval in prose.** Every number you
report must trace to a script output file.

## Contract

**When to use**
- The user wants to know which channels drive outcomes, how to reallocate budget,
  or the marginal ROAS of the next dollar per channel.
- Adstock/saturation modeling, incrementality calibration, or MMM scenario
  planning ("shift 10% from display to search").

**When NOT to use** (route instead)
- Within-platform ad diagnostics — pacing, creative fatigue, CPC, negative
  keywords → `paid-media`.
- Reconciling an MMM against a geo/lift experiment for a budget decision →
  `experimentation:measurement-integration`.
- Designing or analyzing the lift test itself → `marketing-analytics:experimentation`.
- Assembling the executive deck from finished analysis → `reporting`.
- Raw spend/conversion files not yet landed → `data-extraction` first.

**Mode classification** (declare which at the top of your run)

| Mode | Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | "which channel is winning" on already-fit model | Read existing `mmm_channel_contributions.json`, summarize, no refit. |
| **Standard** | New MMM request with clean inputs | Full fit → validate → decompose → optimize → report. |
| **Deep** | Calibration against lift tests, scenario suites, prior-sensitivity emphasis | Standard + informative priors from incrementality, multi-scenario optimization, expanded diagnostics. |

**Inputs**

| File | Description | Required |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `workspace/raw/campaign_spend_{platform}.csv` | Daily/weekly spend by channel (`date`, `channel`, `spend`, `impressions`, `clicks`). | Yes |
| `workspace/raw/conversions.csv` | Outcome at matching grain (`date`, `conversions`, `revenue`). | Yes |
| `workspace/raw/external_factors.csv` | Seasonality, competitor spend, macro (`date`, `factor_name`, `value`). | No |
| `workspace/analysis/incrementality_results.json` | Lift priors from experimentation (`{channel, lift, ci_lower, ci_upper}`). | No |

**Contract references**
- `references/mmm_methodology.md` — adstock/saturation math, prior guidance.
- `references/pymc_marketing_api.md` — PyMC-Marketing MMM usage.
- `references/incrementality_calibration.md` — lift results → informative priors.
- `shared/schemas/data_contracts.md` — canonical field definitions.

**Outputs**

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `workspace/analysis/mmm_channel_contributions.json` | Posterior mean + credible intervals per channel. |
| `workspace/analysis/mmm_budget_optimization.json` | Optimal allocation under current and scenario budgets. |
| `workspace/analysis/mmm_diagnostics.json` | MCMC convergence + fit statistics, framework/version, seeds. |
| `workspace/reports/mmm_executive_summary.html` | Contribution waterfall, reallocation table, marginal ROAS curves — all with uncertainty bands. |

## Workflow

Complete each step before the next. If a gate fails, STOP and report — do not
proceed with a poorly converged model or unvalidated data.

1. **Validate inputs (HARD GATE).** Confirm `workspace/raw/campaign_spend_{platform}.csv`
   and `workspace/raw/conversions.csv` exist. If either is missing, **STOP** and run
   the **data-extraction** skill first. Then run `scripts/fit_mmm.py --validate` to
   check date alignment across inputs, detect/impute missing windows (flagging
   confidence adjustments), and normalize to a unified grain. Default to **weekly**
   grain; use daily only when the dataset spans 2+ years.

2. **Specify priors.** Check for `workspace/analysis/incrementality_results.json`.
   If lift results exist, run `scripts/fit_mmm.py --calibrate` to translate them into
   informative priors (see `references/incrementality_calibration.md`). Otherwise use
   weakly informative priors from `references/mmm_methodology.md`. Always run a prior
   sensitivity analysis (vague vs informative) and report the degree of prior
   influence.

3. **Fit.** Run `scripts/fit_mmm.py` (PyMC-Marketing `MMM`, NUTS/MCMC; geometric or
   Weibull adstock, Hill saturation per channel). If MCMC is impractical, fall back to
   the ridge model in `scripts/_lightweight_mmm.py` and document the tradeoff in
   diagnostics.

4. **Validate the model (HARD GATE).** Run `scripts/validate_model.py`. Require R-hat
   < 1.05 and effective sample size > 400 for all parameters, and posterior predictive
   coverage of 90%+ of observed data within the 90% credible interval. **If diagnostics
   fail, STOP** — reparameterize, add samples, or tighten priors and refit. Do not
   decompose or optimize on a non-converged model.

5. **Decompose.** Run `scripts/compute_contributions.py`. Verify contributions sum to
   the total observed outcome within 2%; separate base (intercept + controls) from
   media-driven components. Write `workspace/analysis/mmm_channel_contributions.json`.

6. **Decision gate — optimization scope.** Before reallocating budget, use
   **AskUserQuestion** to confirm the decision frame when it is not already specified:
   - *Total budget:* hold constant / increase / decrease (by how much)?
   - *Constraints:* per-channel min/max spend, or channels that must not be cut?
   - *Objective:* maximize conversions or revenue?
   Then run `scripts/optimize_budget.py`, propagating posterior uncertainty (use
   posterior samples, not point estimates). Produce marginal ROAS curves and flag
   channels approaching saturation ceilings. Write
   `workspace/analysis/mmm_budget_optimization.json`.

7. **Report.** Write `workspace/analysis/mmm_diagnostics.json` and
   `workspace/reports/mmm_executive_summary.html` (contribution waterfall with
   uncertainty bands, reallocation table with expected-lift estimates, diagnostics,
   marginal ROAS curves). Never present a point estimate without its interval.

8. **FS-mode gate.** If the workspace is tagged financial services and the summary
   contains performance claims or customer-facing language, route the HTML through the
   **compliance-review** skill before distribution. Ask gross vs net of fees; for long
   (12–36 month) financial sales cycles, use longer adstock windows and separate
   lead-gen from AUM-conversion attribution.

**Cross-skill wiring:** upstream `data-extraction` lands raw inputs; `paid-media`
supplies normalized spend and consumes budget targets; `experimentation`
incrementality calibrates priors and MMM in turn flags channels needing new lift
tests; `reporting` consumes all outputs; `compliance-review` gates FS distribution.
Always write outputs in the canonical JSON schemas with metadata (timestamp, model
version, data range) so downstream skills can parse them.

## Output Format

Report to the user in this shape:

```
## Attribution / MMM — <outcome>
Status: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
Mode: Quick | Standard | Deep   Grain: weekly | daily

Model health: R-hat max=<v>, min ESS=<v>, PPC coverage=<pct>
Top contributions (posterior mean [90% CI]):
- <channel>: <share>% [<lo>–<hi>]
Budget move: <from → to>, expected lift <v> [<lo>–<hi>]
Artifacts: workspace/analysis/mmm_*.json, workspace/reports/mmm_executive_summary.html
```

Completion status:
- `DONE` — inputs validated, model converged, contributions + optimization written.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — completed but caveats remain (weak priors, imputed
  windows, borderline diagnostics); state them.
- `BLOCKED` — a hard gate failed (missing inputs, non-convergence); name the file
  or diagnostic.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — cannot proceed without the decision frame, budget constraints,
  or gross/net choice (state exactly what is missing).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not** estimate contributions, ROAS, or intervals in prose — a script
  computes every number.
- **Do not** decompose or optimize on a model that failed convergence diagnostics.
- **Do not** present point estimates without uncertainty bands.
- **Do not** skip prior sensitivity — an MMM whose posterior is driven by the prior
  is a prior, not a measurement.
- **Do not** optimize budget without confirming the objective and constraints.
- **Do not** silently impute missing spend windows; flag confidence adjustments.
- **Do not** distribute FS performance claims without routing through
  `compliance-review`.

Builder-facing acceptance criteria and engineering conventions live in the
plugin's `references/authoring-notes.md`, not in this runtime body.
