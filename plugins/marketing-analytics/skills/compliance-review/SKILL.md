# Compliance-Aware Content Review

**Role:** Read-and-advise. Fix-allowed only within `workspace/compliance/`; you
**never** modify the source content — you flag issues and suggest remediation,
preserving the human compliance officer's final authority.

> **ADVISORY NOTICE (HARD GATE):** This skill provides an advisory first-pass
> review only. It does NOT constitute compliance certification, legal advice, or
> regulatory approval. Every finding requires confirmation by a qualified human
> compliance officer before any content is distributed. Never treat this output
> as a final compliance determination. Every report you emit must restate this
> notice. When in doubt, flag for human review rather than pass content silently.

## Contract

**When to use**
- First-pass regulatory screen of marketing/customer-facing content for SEC
  Marketing Rule 206(4)-1, FINRA Rule 2210, and/or FCA financial-promotions rules.
- The mandatory FS-mode gate other skills route through before distributing
  reports, ad copy, email, or web content.

**When NOT to use** (route instead)
- Experiment conduct-risk, fairness, or trust-erosion review →
  `experimentation:compliance-trust-review`.
- Non-financial brand/voice/style review → outside this plugin's scope.

**Mode classification** (declare which)

| Mode | Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | Single short asset (one ad, one subject line) | Classify → scan → findings; skip archival unless asked. |
| **Standard** | A report or campaign asset for distribution | Full pipeline through archival manifest. |
| **Deep** | Multi-jurisdiction / performance-heavy content | Standard + performance-presentation validation across SEC/FINRA/FCA and disclosure insertion. |

**Inputs**

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| `workspace/reports/*.html` or `*.docx` | Content produced by other skills for distribution. |
| `workspace/reports/mmm_executive_summary.html` | Attribution reports with performance claims. |
| `workspace/analysis/experiment_results.json` | Experiment results used in marketing claims. |

**Rule references (the checklists this pipeline screens against):**
`references/sec_marketing_rule.md`, `references/finra_rule_2210.md`,
`references/fca_financial_promotions.md`, `references/disclosure_templates.md`,
`references/archival_requirements.md`. These are versioned and carry their own
effective dates — screen against the reference, do not hardcode rules here.

**Outputs**

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `workspace/compliance/review_report.json` | Issue-by-issue findings: severity, rule citation, remediation. |
| `workspace/compliance/compliant_content.html` | A *copy* with suggested disclosures inserted (never overwrites source). |
| `workspace/compliance/archival_manifest.json` | Content tagged for regulatory archival with retention metadata. |
| `workspace/compliance/review_log.json` | Append-only, immutable audit trail of all reviews. |

## Workflow

An ordered review pipeline. Each stage feeds the next; do not skip classification
or the advisory notice.

1. **Intake.** Load the content to review. Identify what it is (report, ad copy,
   email, testimonial, web page) and confirm the workspace's regulatory context
   (SEC-registered adviser, FINRA broker-dealer, FCA UK, or multiple). If the
   jurisdiction is ambiguous, screen against all applicable references and say so.

2. **Classify (drives everything downstream).** Run `scripts/content_scanner.py`
   classification to tag the content along five dimensions:
   - **Jurisdiction:** SEC / FINRA / FCA / multiple.
   - **Audience:** institutional (>$50M AUM) / retail (25+ in 30 days) / correspondence.
   - **Content type:** performance / testimonial / educational / promotional / commentary.
   - **Filing requirement:** pre-use / post-use / supervision-only.
   - **Risk level:** High / Medium / Low / Info.

3. **Screen against each applicable regulation's checklist.** For each jurisdiction
   in scope, run `scripts/content_scanner.py` against that reference:
   - **SEC 206(4)-1** (`references/sec_marketing_rule.md`): the seven general
     prohibitions — untrue/unsubstantiated claims, misleading implications, omitted
     material facts, cherry-picked performance, audience-inappropriate claims, and the
     catch-all. Require a traceable workspace data source for every material factual claim.
   - **FINRA 2210** (`references/finra_rule_2210.md`): fair-and-balanced standard,
     benefit/risk balance, prohibition on retail projections, and filing triggers
     (first-year firms, options, structured products, leveraged/inverse ETFs, RICs).
   - **FCA** (`references/fca_financial_promotions.md`): clear/fair/not-misleading,
     product-specific risk warnings, capital-at-risk and complexity warnings,
     target-market appropriateness (PS22/10 high-risk warnings).
   For **performance content**, additionally run `scripts/performance_validator.py`:
   gross/net equal prominence, required 1/5/10-year (or since-inception) periods,
   benchmark inclusion, and hypothetical/back-tested disclosure.

4. **Findings with severity.** Compile each issue with severity, rule citation,
   content location, and suggested remediation. Reserve **HIGH** for clear violations
   (superlatives, guarantees, missing mandatory disclaimer); use **MEDIUM/LOW** for
   judgment calls (tone, emphasis). High-severity violations aim for near-100% recall;
   keep the false-positive rate low on Low/Info to preserve reviewer trust.

5. **Decision gate — disclosure insertion.** When required disclosures are missing,
   use **AskUserQuestion** before writing `compliant_content.html`: insert the
   firm-approved template language (from `references/disclosure_templates.md`), insert
   the regulatory-standard fallback, or leave placeholders for the compliance officer?
   Never silently rewrite the source. Run `scripts/disclosure_inserter.py` on a *copy*.

6. **Advisory report.** Write `workspace/compliance/review_report.json` (schema below)
   with `overall_status` PASS/WARNING/FAIL, the full issue list, disclosures
   required/present/missing, and the classification. Restate the advisory notice in the
   report and set `requires_human_review: true` on every issue.

7. **Archival manifest.** Run `scripts/archival_tagger.py` to write
   `workspace/compliance/archival_manifest.json`: content ID, ISO-8601 review timestamp,
   reviewer `"automated-first-pass"`, retention period (per SEC Rule 17a-4 / FINRA,
   `references/archival_requirements.md`), WORM flag, filing status, and content hash.
   Append the review to the immutable `workspace/compliance/review_log.json`.

**Cross-skill wiring:** this is the terminal FS-mode gate. `reporting`,
`email-analytics`, `paid-media`, `seo-content`, `social-analytics`, and
`attribution-analysis` route customer-facing output here before distribution. It
reads from their output directories and writes only to `workspace/compliance/`;
it does not block other skills from running.

## Output Format

Report to the user with the advisory notice, then the findings summary. The
`review_report.json` schema:

```json
{
  "review_id": "string (UUID)",
  "review_timestamp": "string (ISO 8601)",
  "content_source": "string (file path)",
  "overall_status": "PASS | FAIL | WARNING",
  "advisory_notice": "This is an advisory first-pass review, not compliance certification.",
  "issues": [
    {"issue_id": "string", "severity": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | INFO",
     "category": "SEC | FINRA | FCA | DISCLOSURE | ARCHIVAL",
     "rule_citation": "string", "description": "string", "location": "string",
     "remediation": "string", "requires_human_review": true}
  ],
  "disclosures_required": ["string"],
  "disclosures_present": ["string"],
  "disclosures_missing": ["string"],
  "classification": {"jurisdiction": ["SEC","FINRA","FCA"],
    "audience": "INSTITUTIONAL | RETAIL | CORRESPONDENCE",
    "content_type": "string", "filing_required": "PRE_USE | POST_USE | NONE"},
  "archival_metadata": {"retention_period_years": 0, "worm_required": true,
    "content_hash": "string (SHA-256)"}
}
```

Completion status (this skill never emits an "approved" verdict):
- `DONE` — reviewed, findings + archival manifest written, advisory notice included.
  `overall_status` still requires human confirmation.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — HIGH-severity findings present; distribution should not
  proceed until a human compliance officer clears them.
- `BLOCKED` — content unreadable or jurisdiction undeterminable; name the blocker.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — missing the content, the jurisdiction, or firm disclosure
  templates (state what).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not** certify compliance or emit an "approved" determination — advisory only.
- **Do not** overwrite source content; write suggestions to a copy in `workspace/compliance/`.
- **Do not** hardcode regulatory rules in this body; screen against the versioned references.
- **Do not** use HIGH severity for judgment calls; reserve it for clear violations.
- **Do not** pass content silently when uncertain — flag for human review.
- **Do not** mutate the review log; it is append-only and immutable once written.

Builder-facing acceptance criteria and engineering conventions live in the
plugin's `references/authoring-notes.md`, not in this runtime body.
