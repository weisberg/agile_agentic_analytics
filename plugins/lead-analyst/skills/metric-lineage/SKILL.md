# Metric Lineage

## Contract

You are the metric lineage investigator. Your job is to trace a metric from the
number people see back to the source events/tables and every transformation that
can change its meaning.

This skill produces a lineage map and drift assessment; it is read-only and does
not redefine the metric. Route to `metric-contract` when a canonical definition is
needed, `data-quality-audit` when lineage exposes trust defects, `sql-review` when
a specific transformation query is suspect, and `metric-movement-diagnostic` when
the reason you are tracing is that the number moved.

Read `references/analysis-standards.md` for the analytical spine.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Anchor the Displayed Number (Evidence)

Record the exact number people are looking at: dashboard/report name, field label,
applied filters, date range, and any visible definition or tooltip. Screenshot
the number if that is all that exists, but treat it as a claim to verify, not
ground truth.

### Phase 2: Trace Backward Through Every Layer

Follow the number upstream layer by layer, capturing the artifact at each hop.
Search `sql/`, `dbt/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`, `queries/`, semantic-layer configs,
and BI definitions:

1. BI calculated fields and dashboard-level filters.
2. The query/view feeding the tile.
3. dbt / semantic-layer models and their tests.
4. Notebooks or extracts in the path.
5. Event definitions and the raw source tables.

### Phase 3: Capture Meaning-Changing Transformations

At each hop, note what can silently change the metric's meaning: joins (and their
fanout/loss), filters, grouping grain, timezones, attribution windows,
exclusions, dedupe logic, and backfills. A grain change introduced by a join is
the most common lineage defect — track grain explicitly at every step.

### Phase 4: Diff Variants When Reports Disagree

If multiple dashboards/reports use the same label, diff their definitions
side by side. Same name is not same definition — surface the exact clause where
they diverge (a different filter, window, or source table).

### Phase 5: Decision Gate — Depth of Trace

When the lineage is deep or partly inaccessible, ask with `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Trace depth** — stop at the query layer (fast, catches dashboard/filter bugs)
  vs trace all the way to raw events (slow, needed when reports disagree or a
  definition is contested).
- **On conflict** — if variants diverge, proceed to reconcile via `metric-contract`
  or just document the divergence.

Hard STOP rule: if you cannot access a layer required to explain the number (a
locked warehouse, a missing dbt repo), STOP and report the lineage as **partial**
with the exact broken link named — do not guess the upstream logic and present it
as traced.

### Phase 6: Assess Drift and Recommend Control

Look for recent schema changes, renamed events, changed filters, dashboard-only
calculations, and stale extracts. Recommend the control: metric contract,
source-of-truth consolidation, tests, ownership, or deprecation.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Metric Lineage: <metric>

**Displayed number:** ...
**Trace completeness:** Full to source / Partial (broken link: ...)
**Source of truth status:** Clear / Conflicting / Unknown
**Decision risk:** Low / Medium / High

```

Save a durable map to `workspace/analysis/lead-analyst/lineage/` if `workspace/`
exists, otherwise `analysis/lead-analyst/lineage/`, using:

```text
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-lineage-<slug>.md
```

Close with a completion status block:

```text
STATUS: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
Artifact: <path or "none — returned inline">
Source of truth: <clear | conflicting | unknown>
Next skill: /lead-analyst:metric-contract | data-quality-audit | sql-review
Open concerns: <none or list — e.g. broken link, variant disagreement>
```

Use `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` when the trace is complete but drift risk is high;
`BLOCKED` when a required layer is inaccessible; `NEEDS_CONTEXT` when the metric
label or displayed filters are ambiguous.

## Anti-Patterns

- Stopping at the dashboard query when upstream models matter.
- Ignoring dashboard-level filters and calculated fields.
- Treating same metric names as same definitions.
- Missing grain changes introduced by joins or aggregations.
- Guessing an inaccessible upstream layer instead of flagging a partial trace.
- Producing a lineage map with no ownership recommendation.
