# Funnel Analysis

Multi-step funnel construction, statistical drop-off analysis, bottleneck ranking,
revenue-impact estimation, and CRO hypothesis generation.

## Contract

**Role:** Advisory analyst. Measures conversion and proposes CRO hypotheses; does
not ship page changes or run the experiments. All statistics run in deterministic
Python scripts.

**Mode:**
- `quick` — construct funnel + stage conversion rates with CIs.
- `standard` (default) — add bottleneck ranking, revenue impact, CRO hypotheses.
- `deep` — add segment comparison and time-to-convert / survival analysis.

**When to use:** step-by-step drop-off, checkout/signup/onboarding funnels,
bottleneck prioritization, CRO backlog generation.

**When NOT to use:** for traffic sources and session flows use `web-analytics`;
for running the A/B test that validates a fix use the **experimentation** skill;
for email-sequence conversion use `email-analytics`. See
`../../references/skill-index.md` for the portfolio map.

**Evidence required (inputs):**
- `workspace/raw/events.csv` — `user_id`, `event_name`, `timestamp` (+ optional
  properties). Required. If absent, STOP and run **data-extraction** first.
- `workspace/config/funnel_definition.json` — step sequence, time windows,
  matching mode (optional; auto-inferred if absent).
- `workspace/processed/segments.json` — from audience-segmentation (optional;
  enables cohort comparison).
- `workspace/raw/revenue.csv` — revenue per converter (recommended; enables impact
  estimation).

**Depends on:** data-extraction, web-analytics (event stream). **Feeds into:**
experimentation, reporting, paid-media. Builder detail in
`references/authoring-notes.md`.

**Hard STOP (data integrity):** if `events.csv` is missing required columns, or
the inferred/declared funnel has a step with zero entering users, stop and report
— a funnel that can't be constructed yields meaningless conversion rates.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for inline paths, funnel definition, or window overrides.

## Workflow

1. **Validate inputs.** Load `events.csv`; verify `user_id`, `event_name`,
   `timestamp`. Apply the Hard STOP gate.

2. **Funnel-definition gate (AskUserQuestion).** When no
   `funnel_definition.json` is supplied and multiple plausible step sequences
   exist, ask before constructing:
   - **Question:** "Which funnel should I measure?"
   - **Options:** (a) *Provide the step sequence* — user names ordered steps and
     time window; (b) *Infer from top event sequences* — I derive the dominant
     path and show it for confirmation; (c) *A named standard funnel* (checkout /
     signup / onboarding). Skip when a definition file is present.

3. **Construct.** Run `scripts/build_funnel.py`: assign users to stages, apply
   the time-window filter (users who don't reach the next step within the window
   count as dropped), support strict (ordered) and relaxed (any-order) matching.

4. **Stage metrics.** Run `scripts/funnel_stats.py`: stage conversion rates with
   Wilson score CIs, absolute and relative drop-off, overall funnel conversion.

5. **Segment comparison** (deep mode, if `segments.json` present). Compute per-
   segment funnel metrics; chi-squared tests at each stage with Bonferroni
   correction across >2 segments.

6. **Rank bottlenecks.** Composite score
   `drop_off_rate * sqrt(volume) * revenue_proximity`. Write
   `workspace/analysis/bottleneck_ranking.json`.

7. **Estimate revenue impact.** Run `scripts/revenue_impact.py` with historical
   revenue-per-converter; project the gain from 1/5/10 pp conversion improvements
   at the 50th-percentile (conservative) estimate.

8. **Time-to-convert** (deep mode). Median/percentile time between stages;
   right-censor users still in funnel; flag stages where dwell correlates with
   abandonment and bimodal distributions.

9. **CRO hypotheses.** For each bottleneck emit {observation, hypothesis, test
   type, expected impact, priority} to `workspace/analysis/cro_hypotheses.json`.

10. **Report.** Write outputs and the interactive HTML funnel report.

## Output Format

Artifacts:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `workspace/analysis/funnel_results.json` | Stage conversion rates, drop-offs, CIs |
| `workspace/analysis/bottleneck_ranking.json` | Priority-ranked bottlenecks with impact |
| `workspace/analysis/cro_hypotheses.json` | Test ideas linked to findings |
| `workspace/analysis/time_to_convert.json` | Per-stage time distributions and censoring |
| `workspace/reports/funnel_report.html` | Interactive funnel with drill-down |

**Financial services mode:** account-opening funnels see 50–70% abandonment;
KYC/AML and suitability steps are mandatory. Never recommend removing or shortening
a compliance/disclosure/consent step. Regulated-step CRO must target UX clarity,
progress indicators, and save-and-resume, not step elimination. CRO copy that will
be published routes through **compliance-review**.

**Completion status:**
- `DONE` — funnel constructed, metrics + bottlenecks + hypotheses written.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — e.g., no revenue data (impact omitted), thin volume at a
  stage, inferred funnel unconfirmed.
- `BLOCKED` — Hard STOP tripped (bad/missing events); state the fix.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — funnel definition unresolved by the user.

## Anti-Patterns

- Quoting conversion rates from a funnel that couldn't be validly constructed.
- Normal-approximation CIs at low conversion rates instead of Wilson score.
- Optimistic revenue projections — always use the conservative 50th-percentile
  estimate.
- Ranking bottlenecks by raw drop-off alone, ignoring volume and revenue
  proximity.
- Recommending removal of a regulated step to lift conversion.
- Segment chi-squared tests across many segments without Bonferroni correction.
- Letting the model estimate conversion rates or p-values instead of the scripts.
