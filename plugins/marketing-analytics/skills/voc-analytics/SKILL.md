# Survey & Voice-of-Customer Analytics

NPS/CSAT/CES tracking with bootstrap CIs, LLM-based open-text theme extraction,
key-driver analysis, and satisfaction-behavior correlation.

## Contract

**Role:** Advisory analyst. Measures satisfaction and extracts themes; does not
contact respondents. Metric computation runs in deterministic Python scripts;
theme extraction uses a structured LLM call.

**Mode:**
- `quick` — NPS/CSAT/CES with confidence intervals.
- `standard` (default) — add open-text theme extraction and key-driver analysis.
- `deep` — add segment cross-tabs, satisfaction-behavior correlation, trend
  detection.

**When to use:** NPS/CSAT/CES metrics, survey verbatim/theme analysis, key
satisfaction drivers, satisfaction trends.

**When NOT to use:** sentiment on public social posts → `social-analytics`;
customer clustering → `audience-segmentation`; email feedback surveys' delivery →
`email-analytics`. See `../../references/skill-index.md`.

**Evidence required (inputs):**
- `workspace/raw/survey_responses.csv` — `respondent_id`, `question_id`,
  `response`, `score`, `timestamp`. Required. If absent, STOP and run
  **data-extraction** first.
- `workspace/processed/segments.json` — from audience-segmentation (optional;
  cross-tabs).
- `workspace/analysis/clv_predictions.json` — from clv-modeling (optional;
  satisfaction-value correlation).

**Depends on:** data-extraction, audience-segmentation. **Feeds into:** reporting,
seo-content, email-analytics. Builder detail in `references/authoring-notes.md`.

**Hard STOP (PII / low sample):** (a) Before sending any open-text to an external
LLM, run PII detection and redact account-specific information — STOP extraction if
redaction can't be confirmed. (b) If a segment has fewer than 30 responses, do not
report its metric as reliable — flag it low-confidence rather than emitting a
precise number.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for inline paths, metric type, or theme taxonomy.

## Workflow

1. **Validate inputs.** Load `survey_responses.csv`; verify columns; confirm score
   ranges match the metric (0–10 NPS, 1–5 CSAT, 1–7 CES). Apply the low-sample Hard
   STOP per segment.

2. **Compute metrics.** Run `scripts/compute_metrics.py`: NPS (%Promoters −
   %Detractors), CSAT (top-box %), CES (mean effort), each with bootstrap CIs
   (≥10,000 iterations). See `references/survey_methodology.md`.

3. **Theme-taxonomy gate (AskUserQuestion).** Before extracting open-text themes,
   confirm the approach:
   - **Question:** "How should I categorize open-text responses?"
   - **Options:** (a) *Predefined taxonomy* — you supply the theme list, best for
     tracking known issues over time; (b) *Emergent discovery* — the LLM proposes
     themes from the data; (c) *Hybrid* — predefined plus emergent additions
     (default). Then apply the PII Hard STOP before any external LLM call.

4. **Extract themes.** Run `scripts/text_categorization.py`: structured LLM
   categorization into the chosen taxonomy with sentiment + intensity per response;
   handle multilingual input. See `references/text_analytics.md`.

5. **Key drivers.** Run `scripts/key_driver_analysis.py`: permutation importance
   (random forest) linking themes/touchpoints to Promoter vs Detractor
   classification — not bivariate correlation.

6. **Trends** (deep mode). Run `scripts/satisfaction_trends.py`: detect significant
   shifts over time; flag NPS movement > 5 points; control for seasonality and
   response-mix.

7. **Cross-tabulate** (deep mode). If `segments.json` present, break metrics down
   by segment/product/channel/touchpoint; surface high-value Detractors and
   low-effort Promoters (respecting the low-sample gate).

8. **Correlate with behavior** (deep mode). If `clv_predictions.json` present, link
   satisfaction to CLV/retention with explicit correlation-not-causation
   disclaimers.

9. **Report.** Write outputs and the HTML dashboard.

## Output Format

Artifacts:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `workspace/analysis/satisfaction_metrics.json` | NPS, CSAT, CES with CIs and trend significance |
| `workspace/analysis/text_themes.json` | Theme extraction with frequency and sentiment |
| `workspace/analysis/satisfaction_drivers.json` | Key-driver analysis linking themes to scores |
| `workspace/reports/voc_dashboard.html` | Voice-of-customer dashboard |

Report states: metric definitions used, CI method, theme taxonomy, low-confidence
segments (n<30), and the causal disclaimer on any correlation.

**Financial services mode:** survey data may hold PII subject to data-protection
rules — apply access controls and anonymization; NPS/satisfaction used in marketing
claims must meet SEC Marketing Rule testimonial provisions (no endorsement framing
without disclaimers); run PII detection/redaction before sending text to external
LLM APIs. Satisfaction claims used in marketing route through **compliance-review**.

**Completion status:**
- `DONE` — metrics, themes, and drivers written with CIs.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — e.g., low-confidence segments, PII redaction limited
  extraction, thin verbatim volume.
- `BLOCKED` — PII Hard STOP unresolved or missing survey data; state the fix.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — theme taxonomy unresolved by the user.

## Anti-Patterns

- Sending un-redacted open-text with account details to an external LLM.
- Reporting a segment metric as precise when n < 30.
- Normal-approximation CIs on NPS instead of bootstrapping.
- Key drivers from bivariate correlation instead of permutation importance.
- Presenting satisfaction-behavior correlation as causation.
- Letting the model compute NPS or confidence intervals instead of the scripts.
