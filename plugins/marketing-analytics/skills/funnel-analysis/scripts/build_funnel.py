"""Funnel construction from event sequences with time-window filtering.

This module builds multi-step conversion funnels from raw event-level data.
It supports strict (ordered) and relaxed (any-order) step matching, configurable
time windows between stages, and both user-based and session-based aggregation.

Typical usage:
    events = load_events("workspace/raw/events.csv")
    definition = load_funnel_definition("workspace/config/funnel_definition.json")
    funnel = build_funnel(events, definition)
    save_funnel(funnel, "workspace/analysis/funnel_results.json")
