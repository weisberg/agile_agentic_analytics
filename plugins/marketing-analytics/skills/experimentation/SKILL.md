# Marketing-Workspace Experimentation & Causal Statistics

**Role:** Fix-allowed within `workspace/analysis/` and `workspace/reports/`. You
own the **scripted statistics layer** for marketing experiments held in the
workspace — CUPED, SRM, power, sequential, frequentist, Bayesian. **Hard gate:
all statistics run in the deterministic scripts under `scripts/`; never estimate
a p-value, posterior, sample size, or variance reduction in prose.**

## Contract

**When to use**
- Marketing experiment data is in `workspace/raw/experiment_data.csv` and needs
  rigorous analysis (CUPED, SRM, guardrails, novelty/primacy, Bayesian + frequentist).
- Pre-experiment design math: power, MDE, duration from historical traffic.
- Producing incrementality lift estimates that calibrate the MMM in
  `attribution-analysis`.

**When NOT to use** (route instead)
- Standalone experiment design/analysis not wired to a marketing workspace, or
  hands-on lifecycle and implementation review → **ab-testing plugin**
  (`ab-testing:design-experiment`, `ab-testing:sample-size`,
  `ab-testing:analyze-results`).
- Regulated/high-trust governance, ship-vs-kill decision reviews, conduct-risk
  and trust review → **experimentation plugin**
  (`experimentation:experiment-decision-review`, `experimentation:compliance-trust-review`).
- Reconciling an experiment against an MMM for a budget call →
  `experimentation:measurement-integration`.
- Segments not yet defined → `audience-segmentation` first.
- Raw experiment file not yet landed → `data-extraction` first.

**Mode classification** (declare which)

| Mode | Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | Design math only ("how big / how long") | Power/MDE/duration; no result analysis. |
| **Standard** | Completed experiment | SRM → CUPED → frequentist + Bayesian → guardrails → report. |
| **Deep** | Ongoing or high-stakes | Standard + sequential monitoring, novelty/primacy time-window analysis, incrementality export. |

**Inputs**

| File | Description | Required |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `workspace/raw/experiment_data.csv` | User-level: `user_id`, `variant`, `metric`, `timestamp`. | Yes |
| `workspace/raw/pre_experiment_covariates.csv` | Pre-period metric values for CUPED. | No (recommended) |
| `workspace/processed/segments.json` | Segment definitions from audience-segmentation. | No |

**Contract references:** `references/experiment_design.md` (power/MDE/duration),
`references/cuped_methodology.md`, `references/sequential_testing.md`,
`references/bayesian_ab.md`, `shared/schemas/data_contracts.md`.

**Outputs**

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `workspace/analysis/experiment_results.json` | Effect sizes, CIs, p-values, Bayesian posteriors. |
| `workspace/analysis/cuped_adjustment.json` | CUPED theta and variance reduction achieved. |
| `workspace/analysis/incrementality_results.json` | Lift estimates consumable by attribution-analysis. |
| `workspace/reports/experiment_report.html` | Forest plots, posteriors, monitoring charts, plain-language recommendation. |

## Workflow

Complete each step before the next. A failed gate is a STOP, not a warning.

1. **Validate inputs (HARD GATE).** Load `workspace/raw/experiment_data.csv`; verify
   `user_id`, `variant`, `metric`, `timestamp`. If covariates are provided, confirm the
   covariate window ends **before** treatment assignment (post-treatment covariates
   bias CUPED — reject them). If the file is absent, **STOP** and run **data-extraction**
   first.

2. **SRM check (HARD STOP rule).** Run `scripts/srm_check.py`. If the chi-squared
   goodness-of-fit p < 0.001, **halt analysis** — the experiment is broken until
   explained. Report the mismatch broken down by platform, date, and segment. Do not
   report a "winner" from an SRM-positive test.

3. **Design or analyze.**
   - *Pre-experiment:* run `scripts/power_analysis.py` for required sample size, MDE,
     and duration given historical traffic. Stop here for Quick mode.
   - *Post-experiment:* continue to step 4.

4. **CUPED (when covariates available).** Run `scripts/cuped.py` to regress each metric
   on its pre-experiment covariate, compute theta, and produce adjusted values
   (`Y_adj = Y - theta*(X - mean(X))`). Log the variance reduction achieved.

5. **Frequentist analysis.** Run `scripts/frequentist_test.py` on raw and CUPED-adjusted
   metrics. Apply Benjamini-Hochberg correction across all metrics. Default to two-sided
   tests; one-sided only with explicit justification. Classify significant vs exploratory.

6. **Bayesian analysis.** Run `scripts/bayesian_test.py` for posteriors, probability of
   being best, and expected loss per variant. Let the user choose the decision framework
   — always compute both.

7. **Sequential monitoring (ongoing experiments).** Run `scripts/sequential_test.py` for
   always-valid CIs (mSPRT) and stopping boundaries. Enforce the pre-specified
   alpha-spending; do not let ad-hoc peeking pass as a decision.

8. **Guardrails and novelty.** Verify no variant degrades a guardrail metric beyond its
   threshold; flag violations. Segment by time window and test for a trend in effect size
   (flat = real, decaying = novelty, growing = primacy).

9. **Decision gate — interpretation frame.** When results are borderline (significant but
   below the pre-registered MDE, or CUPED flips the conclusion), use **AskUserQuestion**
   to confirm how the user wants to act: hold to the pre-registered decision rule, treat
   as exploratory, or extend the test. Do not silently pick. Note: shipping/governance
   *decisions* belong to the experimentation plugin — surface the statistics; do not
   adjudicate conduct risk here.

10. **Report + export.** Write `experiment_results.json`, `cuped_adjustment.json`, and
    (when a lift is estimated) `incrementality_results.json` for MMM calibration. Build
    `workspace/reports/experiment_report.html`.

11. **FS-mode gate.** In financial-services workspaces: all investor-facing variants must
    be compliance-pre-approved before launch, required disclosures cannot be the variable
    under test, and any result claim used in marketing must carry statistical-methodology
    footnotes. Route customer-facing outputs through **compliance-review**.

**Cross-skill wiring:** incrementality results calibrate `attribution-analysis`
MMM priors; `funnel-analysis` generates hypotheses this skill tests;
`email-analytics` delegates send-time and subject-line testing here for rigor;
CUPED covariates draw on `web-analytics` pre-period data; `reporting` consumes
result summaries.

## Output Format

```
## Experimentation — <experiment name>
Status: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
Mode: Quick | Standard | Deep

SRM: p=<v> (PASS | FAIL-HALT)
Effect: <metric> <delta> [<lo>–<hi>], p=<v> (BH-adj); CUPED var-reduction=<pct>
Bayesian: P(best)=<pct>, expected loss=<v>
Recommendation: <plain language>
Artifacts: workspace/analysis/experiment_results.json, workspace/reports/experiment_report.html
```

Completion status:
- `DONE` — validated, SRM clean, both analyses run, report written.
- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — completed with caveats (novelty trend, weak covariate,
  underpowered); state them.
- `BLOCKED` — SRM failure or missing required columns; name the gate.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — missing the interpretation frame, covariate window, or the
  experiment file (state what).

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not** report results from an SRM-positive experiment — halt and diagnose.
- **Do not** estimate p-values, posteriors, or variance reduction in prose.
- **Do not** use post-treatment covariates in CUPED.
- **Do not** peek and stop early outside the pre-specified sequential boundaries.
- **Do not** claim a win in a post-hoc segment when the overall result is null.
- **Do not** adjudicate ship/kill or conduct risk here — that is the
  experimentation plugin's job; produce the statistics and hand off.
- **Do not** launch FS investor-facing variants without compliance pre-approval.

Builder-facing acceptance criteria and engineering conventions live in the
plugin's `references/authoring-notes.md`, not in this runtime body.
