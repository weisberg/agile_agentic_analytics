# vaultli

`vaultli` is a CLI for building and maintaining a file-based knowledge vault.

It helps agents and humans turn a directory of markdown files, SQL queries, templates, runbooks, and other assets into a structured knowledge base with:

- YAML frontmatter for document metadata
- sidecar markdown for non-markdown assets
- a derived `INDEX.jsonl` for fast lookup and filtering
- validation checks for broken or stale vault state

The source of truth is always the files on disk. `INDEX.jsonl` is just a cache built from those files.

## What It Does

`vaultli` standardizes how knowledge is stored and discovered:

- Native markdown files keep their metadata inline in frontmatter.
- Non-markdown assets such as `.sql` or `.j2` files get sidecar docs like `query.sql.md`.
- Each indexed document gets a stable `id`, `title`, `description`, and other retrieval-friendly metadata.
- The vault can be re-indexed and validated at any time.

This makes the vault easier to:

- search
- audit
- version with git
- consume from agents
- evolve without a database

## Core Model

vaultli is built around three ideas:

1. Markdown is the universal knowledge wrapper.
2. YAML frontmatter is the universal metadata format.
3. JSONL is the universal index format.

A typical vault looks like this:

```text
kb/
  .kbroot
  INDEX.jsonl
  docs/
    guide.md
  queries/
    retention.sql
    retention.sql.md
  templates/
    campaign_report.j2
    campaign_report.j2.md
```

## What It Does Not Do

`vaultli` is not a document database or vector retrieval engine.

- `search` works against `INDEX.jsonl`, not raw document bodies.
- Non-markdown files are invisible until they have sidecars.
- `validate` reports problems but does not auto-fix them.
- `INDEX.jsonl` should not be edited by hand.

If you want the actual content behind a match, use `resolve`, `cat`, or
`context`. These commands hydrate files after `search` has narrowed the
candidate set.

## Main Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `init [path]` | Create a new vault root with `.kbroot` and an empty `INDEX.jsonl` |
| `index [--full]` | Rebuild the vault index |
| `search <query>` | Search indexed metadata, optionally narrowed by filters, sorted, explained, or matched with experimental `--semantic` token overlap |
| `federated-search --vault <root>` | Search multiple vaults and annotate each result with its vault origin |
| `show <id>` | Show one indexed record by `id` |
| `resolve <id>` | Resolve an indexed record to its markdown file, optional body, and optional source asset |
| `cat <id>` | Print the markdown body or sidecar source content for an indexed record |
| `context [query]` | Assemble a deterministic, token-budgeted context bundle from search results or explicit IDs |
| `add <file>` | Scaffold metadata for a file and re-index |
| `scaffold <file>` | Create frontmatter or sidecar metadata without re-indexing |
| `ingest <path>` | Bulk scaffold missing metadata for one file or a directory, with optional include/exclude globs |
| `set <target> <field> <value>` | Set one frontmatter field by path or indexed ID |
| `unset <target> <field>` | Remove one frontmatter field by path or indexed ID |
| `refresh <target>` | Refresh inferred metadata fields while preserving body content |
| `validate` | Report broken sources, duplicate ids, dangling refs, and stale index state |
| `git-info [target]` | Return repository and optional file state for a vault item |
| `root [path]` | Find the nearest vault root |
| `make-id <file>` | Derive the canonical vault id for a file |
| `infer <file>` | Preview inferred metadata without writing |
| `dump-index` | Dump all index records as JSON |

Commands that operate on an existing vault accept `--root`; path-oriented
commands such as `init` and `root` use their positional path instead. Agent
workflows should usually use `--json`.

## Quickstart

The Rust binary is the default implementation. Build once:

```bash
cd rs && cargo build --release
# binary is now at ./target/release/vaultli
```

Then (either put it on your PATH or invoke by full path):

```bash
vaultli --help
vaultli --json init ./kb
vaultli --json add ./kb/docs/guide.md --root ./kb
vaultli --json scaffold ./kb/queries/retention.sql --root ./kb
vaultli --json ingest ./kb --root ./kb --dry-run
vaultli --json ingest ./kb --root ./kb --dry-run --include 'queries/*.sql' --exclude 'queries/tmp*'
vaultli --json index --root ./kb
vaultli --json validate --root ./kb
vaultli --json search retention --root ./kb
vaultli --json search --root ./kb --category query --tag retention --sort priority --limit 5
vaultli --json search "retention query" --root ./kb --semantic --explain
vaultli --json show queries/retention --root ./kb
vaultli --json resolve queries/retention --root ./kb --body --source
vaultli cat queries/retention --root ./kb --source
vaultli --json context --root ./kb --id queries/retention --token-budget 2000
vaultli --json federated-search retention --vault ./kb --vault ../team-kb
vaultli --json git-info queries/retention --root ./kb
```

Python fallback (invoke with the parent of the `vaultli` package on `PYTHONPATH`):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=<parent-of-vaultli> python -m vaultli --help
```

## Sidecars

For non-markdown files, `vaultli` uses same-directory sidecars:

| Source file | Sidecar |
|---|---|
| `report.sql` | `report.sql.md` |
| `template.j2` | `template.j2.md` |
| `config.yaml` | `config.yaml.md` |

The sidecar carries metadata and optional prose documentation, including a required `source` field such as:

```yaml
source: ./report.sql
```

## Recommended Agent Workflow

For a new agent, the safest default loop is:

1. Find the vault root with `root`.
2. Use `ingest --dry-run` to preview bulk metadata scaffolding for a directory.
3. Use `add` for individual markdown files, `scaffold` for individual non-markdown files, or `ingest --index` for bulk scaffolding.
4. Improve the inferred metadata, especially `description`, `tags`, and `category`.
5. Run `index`.
6. Run `validate`.
7. Use `search` to shortlist records, then `resolve`, `cat`, or `context` to hydrate the real files.

Use first-class filters before reaching for `--jq`: `--category`, `--status`,
`--domain`, `--scope`, repeated `--tag`, `--limit`, `--sort`, `--order`, and
`--explain` all operate on indexed metadata and are available in both
implementations. `--semantic` is experimental token-overlap matching over
indexed metadata, not vector retrieval.

Use `ingest --include` and `ingest --exclude` with relative-path globs when
preparing large trees. This keeps dry-runs small, reviewable, and safe for a
new agent.

## Implementations

vaultli currently ships in two implementations:

| Area | Rust | Python |
|---|---|---|
| Role | Primary implementation for agents and day-to-day use | Reference implementation and parity oracle |
| Run | `cd rs && cargo build --release && ./target/release/vaultli ...` | `PYTHONPATH=<parent-of-vaultli> python -m vaultli ...` |
| Strength | Fast startup, compiled binary, modular crate layout | Easy to inspect, debug, and compare behavior |
| Command surface | Same subcommands and flags as Python | Same subcommands and flags as Rust |
| Tests | Unit, integration, and parity tests | Pytest coverage for core and CLI workflows |

Both implementations are intended to be behaviorally identical for normal CLI
workflows. The Rust crate's parity suite compares key outputs against the Python
reference. The package can be relocated freely; set `VAULTLI_PY_PATH` if you
want to run the parity tests from outside the default in-repo layout.

New agents should use the Rust binary unless it is unavailable or they are
debugging a suspected Rust-specific issue. The Python implementation is still
kept current so it can serve as a readable reference and cross-check.

## Stability And Release Expectations

The stable core is the flat-file workflow: `init`, `add`, `scaffold`, `ingest`,
`index`, `validate`, `search`, `show`, `resolve`, `cat`, metadata maintenance,
and JSON envelopes. `search --semantic`, `context`, `federated-search`, and
`git-info` are implemented, dependency-light retrieval/operations helpers, but
should still be treated as experimental surfaces until broader vaults exercise
them.

Before release or CI promotion, run:

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run pytest tests/test_vaultli.py
cd tools/vaultli/rs && cargo test
```

Compatibility expectation: Rust and Python should expose the same normal
agent-facing commands and JSON shapes. If they intentionally diverge, document
the divergence here and in `SKILL.md`.
